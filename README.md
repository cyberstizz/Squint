#             **Squint Frontend**

## This is a React application

### this project includes
* React

### Synopsis
this appliction is the front end of a applicaation that connects to a spring
boot backend.It was first created in 2020 and completed in 2023. The application
is a dashboard for a produc tivity and task management system that we call a "structure for success". Users can set their goals and created other relics of
their personal journies with things like booklists and affirmations.


### Goal Setting
this application is centered around goal setting. since every action has some 
motivation or end goal behind it, it is the core of the Squint application.


### whats the catch?
users can not set a goal without an expeted time to complete it, as well
as steps that will be taken to complete it in the users daily schedule.
because this, users are forced to hold themselves accountable.




### Code Review
This code is written in React. And it is the old react using class based components.

### final thought
Squint is designed to help anyone on their journey to achieving their aspiriations in life. the more people that I can help do that, the more successful this project is. further, the constant challenges that I have encountered during the execution of this project has been helpul to my coding journey in an immesurable way.
